## Rules / lifecycle

**Lifecycle transitions:**
```
BACKLOG → (explicit owner decision) → ACTIVE → (completed/superseded) → ARCHIVE
```

**Key rules:**
- `docs/plans/README.md` = canonical plans registry
- Implementation plans live only in `active/`, `backlog/`, `archive/`
- No canonical `/plan.md` in repository root
- ACTIVE plans are executable roadmaps only after explicit task command
- BACKLOG plans must NOT be implemented automatically
- ARCHIVED plans are historical references only
- Exactly one plan should be marked PRIMARY
- Moving lifecycle state requires file move + registry update in same commit
- Folder status and registry status must always match
- Meaningful implementation commits must synchronize the active plan and this registry with factual validation/review status and the exact next action
- Implementation agents must not claim external review/acceptance that did not happen
- Detailed plan rules live in the plan file, not duplicated into AGENTS.md
